# Virtual Assistant with LangChain

A powerful virtual assistant system with tool usage functions that support RAG, such as calendar management, note-taking capabilities for persistent memory, python code execution, and web search functionality. It is built with Python, LangChain, and Tkinter that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with an AI assistant.

## Features

- ü§ñ AI-powered conversation using local LLM models (via Ollama)
- üìÖ Calendar management with event scheduling and reminders
- üìù Note-taking and knowledge base using vector storage
- üîç Web search capabilities
- üíæ Persistent storage for calendar events and knowledge base
- üéØ Tool-enabled agent mode for enhanced capabilities
- üé® Modern Tkinter-based GUI interface

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Ollama installed and running locally
- Required Python packages (see Installation section)


## Configuration

The system can be configured by modifying the following variables in `main.py`:

- `USER_NAME`: Your preferred name
- `HOST_NAME`: Assistant's name
- `LOCAL_MODEL_NAME`: Your preferred Ollama model
- `EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME`: Your preferred embedding model
- `CALENDAR_REMINDER_MINUTES`: Time before event to show reminder
- `CALENDAR_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS`: How often to check for upcoming events

## Usage

1. Start the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

2. The main interface provides:
   - Chat window for conversation
   - Calendar view showing upcoming events
   - Tools toggle for enabling/disabling agent capabilities

3. Key features:
   - Type messages in the input field and press Enter or click Send
   - Use the calendar view to see upcoming events
   - Enable/disable tools using the checkbox
   - Save chat history using File menu
   - Clear chat history using File menu

## Calendar Management

The assistant can help you:
- Add events to your calendar
- View upcoming events
- Receive reminders for upcoming events
- Manage event scheduling

## Knowledge Base

The system maintains a persistent knowledge base that:
- Stores important information and notes
- Uses vector embeddings for semantic search
- Allows retrieval of relevant information based on queries

## Development

The system is built using:
- LangChain for AI/LLM integration
- FAISS for vector storage
- SQLite for calendar persistence
- Tkinter for the GUI
- Threading for background tasks
