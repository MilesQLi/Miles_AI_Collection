# Intelligent Linux Web Console

A web-based Linux terminal console powered by LangChain and LLMs that helps users execute commands through natural language understanding.

## Features

- üåê Web-based terminal interface
- ü§ñ AI-powered command suggestions using LangChain
- üíª Real-time command execution
- üìÅ Directory navigation support
- üîí Secure command execution with confirmation prompts

## How It Works

The console allows you to:
1. Execute standard Linux commands directly
2. Get AI assistance for command creation using natural language

### AI Command Assistant

To get help creating a command, use the `ask` keyword followed by your request in quotes:

```bash
ask "Find all PDF files in the current directory and its subdirectories"
```

The AI will:
1. Process your request
2. Provide an explanation
3. Suggest the exact command
4. Ask for confirmation before execution

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **AI Integration**: LangChain with Ollama
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication
- **Model**: Qwen 2.5 (14B-instruct)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install fastapi langchain-openai uvicorn
```

3. Run the server:
```bash
python main.py
```

4. Access the web console at: `http://localhost:5001`

## Environment Setup

The application requires:
- Python 3.7+
- Ollama running locally with Qwen 2.5 model
- Access to a Linux environment

## Usage Examples

1. Directory listing with AI:
```bash
ask "Show me all files and their sizes in a human-readable format"
```

2. Finding specific files:
```bash
ask "Find all Python files modified in the last 24 hours"
```

3. System information:
```bash
ask "Show me system memory usage in a human-readable format"
```

## Security Considerations

- All AI-suggested commands require user confirmation before execution
- Commands are executed in a controlled environment
- Working directory is isolated to `/workspace/` by default
